# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 29th May 2018

**Today's Progress**: Created new learning plan in Google Sheets. Start working through Udacity's CS101 daily. Done Lesson 5, 1 to 22. Starting Python While Loops tomorrow.

**Thoughts:** Need to stick to learning plan, and trying to learn one thing at a time.
